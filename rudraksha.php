						<h2>Rudraksha</h2>
						<p>Rudraksha is the seed of a particular tree species which usually grows at a certain altitude in the mountains – mainly in the Himalayan region. Rudraksha beads are believed to provide good support for those who are constantly on the move and who eat and sleep in a variety of places. This is because they are claimed to create a cocoon made of the wearer's own energy. Today, they are mostly found in Nepal, Burma, Thailand or Indonesia. They are there in some parts of the Western Ghats in South India, but the best quality ones come from a certain altitude in Himalayas because somehow the soil, atmosphere, and everything influences it. These seeds have a very unique vibration. Rudraksha, being organic, is preferably worn in ways that do not involve metal; thus on a cord or thong rather than a chain.</p>
